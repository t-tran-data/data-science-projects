# Data Science projects

This repository is a collection of data science projects exploring machine learning, analysis, and visualisation.

## Projects

### Project 1. Comparison of ML models on Electrical Grid Stability Data
- **Goal:** Compare the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms on a classification task.  
- **Methods:**  
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Model training with multiple algorithms (e.g., SVM, decision trees, etc.)  
  - Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
  - Insights into model strengths and weaknesses  

### Project 2. Regression and Classification with Dimensionality Reduction and Regularisation
- **Goal:** Explore regression and classification models with and without dimensionality reduction and regularisation.  
- **Methods:**  
  - Train/test split for model evaluation  
  - Linear regression performance analysis with multiple metrics  
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction  
  - Logistic regression with PCA-transformed data  
  - Application of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularisation  
  - Comparison of performance before and after applying PCA/regularisation  

### Project 3: ML algorithms: Power Consumption Prediction (Tetouan Case Study)  
- **Goal:** Replicates and extends the study *“Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Power Consumption Prediction – Case Study of Tetouan City”*.

- **Methods:**
- Models tested: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Linear Regression.  
- Two analyses performed:  
  (1). 10-minute interval data (train/test evaluation).  
  (2). Hourly aggregated data.  
- Developed an XGBoost model on both 10-minute and hourly data.  
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE and MAE.  
- Reported results in comparative tables and visualised with bar plots.
  
## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply supervised learning models (regression and classification).  
- Explore dimensionality reduction using PCA.  
- Evaluate models with standard performance metrics.  
- Compare baseline models with enhanced models using feature reduction and regularisation.
- Explore how traditional ML models compare with XGBoost in short-interval and aggregated time series forecasting.
