# Data Science projects

This repository is a collection of data science projects exploring machine learning, analysis, and visualisation.

## Projects

### Project 1. Comparison of ML models on Electrical Grid Stability Data
- **Goal:** Compare the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms on a classification task.  
- **Methods:**  
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Model training with multiple algorithms (e.g., SVM, decision trees, etc.)  
  - Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
  - Insights into model strengths and weaknesses  

### Project 2. Regression and Classification with Dimensionality Reduction and Regularisation
- **Goal:** Explore regression and classification models with and without dimensionality reduction and regularisation.  
- **Methods:**  
  - Train/test split for model evaluation  
  - Linear regression performance analysis with multiple metrics  
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction  
  - Logistic regression with PCA-transformed data  
  - Application of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularisation  
  - Comparison of performance before and after applying PCA/regularisation  

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply supervised learning models (regression and classification).  
- Explore dimensionality reduction using PCA.  
- Evaluate models with standard performance metrics.  
- Compare baseline models with enhanced models using feature reduction and regularisation.
